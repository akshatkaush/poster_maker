# poster_maker
Made a website which used templates of poster and asked user for the content to be put up on the poster dynamically. Php gd library with object oriented approach was used for easy handling and additions of new templates to the website. It greatly reduced the work of graphic designer when work was to be done on the same template again and again. Very efficient for instagram pages which post content on same templates with different colours. More templates with same colours can also be added.
An example by the name of image(1).png has also been uploaded.
You can set font file, font size, font shadow(size colour, distance), font stroke(size and colour), font colour and text box size. You can also set alignment of text ehther left to right or top to bottom.

Working example is   http://designatak.tk/
